# Reel Roll Repeat

Itch.io: [Reel Roll Repeat](https://dlowl.itch.io/reel-roll-repeat)

Made for [The Fishing Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/the-fishing-game-jam)

Fish don't want to be caught, that one is obvious. But what if they were gambling addicts at the same time? That's the exact situation we have here

1. Reel a fish in
2. Play a game of dice against it -- if you win, you get the catch; if you lose, well, you gotta give one fish back.
